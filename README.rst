 Introduction to PyFiberAmp
===========================

In short
============
PyFiberAmp is a rate equation simulation tool for rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers and fiber lasers partly based on the Giles
model [1]_. PyFiberAmp allows an arbitrary number of user-defined time-varying signals from continuous-wave steady-state operation to nanosecond pulses in both
core-pumped and double-clad fiber amplifiers. It also includes reflective boundary conditions for modeling simple CW, gain-switched and
Q-switched fiber lasers. The time-dynamic simulations are accelerated by a dedicated partial differential equation solver written in C++.
In addition to signal and pump beams, PyFiberAmp also supports amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and stimulated and spontaneous Raman scattering effects (SRS) [2]_ (SRS only in steady-state simulations).
Documentation (still in progress) is available on `Read the Docs <https://pyfiberamp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Download
=========
PyFiberAmp is not yet on PyPI. You can clone the repository with
::

    $ git clone git://github.com/Jomiri/pyfiberamp.git

and then install the library with
::

    python setup.py install

Example
========
The simple example below demonstrates a core-pumped Yb-doped fiber amplifier. All units are in SI.
::

    from pyfiberamp import FiberAmplifierSimulation
    from pyfiberamp.fibers import YbDopedFiber

    yb_number_density = 2e25 # m^-3
    core_r = 3e-6
    background_loss = 0
    length = 2.5 # m
    core_na = 0.12
    tolerance = 1e-5

    fiber = YbDopedFiber(length=length,
                        core_radius=core_r,
                        ion_number_density=yb_number_density,
                        background_loss=background_loss,
                        core_na=core_na)
    simulation = FiberAmplifierSimulation()
    simulation.fiber = fiber
    simulation.add_cw_signal(wl=1035e-9, power=2e-3)
    simulation.add_forward_pump(wl=976e-9, power=300e-3)
    simulation.add_ase(wl_start=1000e-9, wl_end=1080e-9, n_bins=40)

    result = simulation.run(tol=tolerance)
    result.plot_amplifier_result()

The script plots the power evolution in the amplifier and the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectra. The
co-propagating pump is absorbed in the first ~1.8 m while the signal experiences gain. When the pump has been depleted,
the signal starts to be reabsorbed by the fiber. This design is not perfect 1) because the fiber is too long and
2) because the input signal is too weak to saturate the gain at the start of the fiber.

Fiber data
==========
PyFiberAmp comes with spectroscopic data (absorption and emission cross sections) for Yb-doped germanosilicate fibers
[3]_ and supports importing spectra for other dopants/glass-compositions.

Theory basics
==============
